# Introduction

The following data comes from [termometropolitico.it](https://www.termometropolitico.it/sondaggi-politici-elettorali) and refer to the period of time Dec 18 to Dec 24 of 2017. Only parties with 5%+ have been included.

| Party | Initials | % | Leader
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Movimento 5 Stelle | M5S | 27.7 | [Luigi di Maio](https://twitter.com/luigidimaio)*
| Partito Democratico | PD | 24.2 | [Matteo Renzi](https://twitter.com/matteorenzi)
| Forza Italia | FI | 15.7 | [Silvio Berlusconi](https://twitter.com/berlusconi)
| Lega Nord | Lega | 13.7 | [Matteo Salvini](https://twitter.com/matteosalvinimi)
| Libert√† e Uguaglianza | LeU | 6.9 | [Pietro Grasso](https://twitter.com/PietroGrasso)
| Fratelli d'Italia | FDI | 5.2 | [Giorgia Meloni](https://twitter.com/GiorgiaMeloni)

*Many would argue that the *de facto* leader of the party is Beppe Grillo; as Luigi di Maio won the most recent primary elections, I decided to go with him.

# The analysis

## Data collection

Save the tweets.

## Sentiment analysis

Use http://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Sentiment.html to compute

## Keywords

For each candidate, top 10 tfidf words (exclude stop words)

## Clustering

Use word embedding to generate average vectors for each individual tweet. Add sentiment score. Cluster with k=2 (left/right) and k=3 (left/right/other). Reduce dimensionality to 2 to display results (each tweet a point; color of the point for the party; bakcground color for the cluster; if too complicated, the use colours for clusters and shape points for party or viceversa).
